  <p>The green spaces of Melbourne’s inner-city urban fabric are rapidly being filled up with built form, with very few positive effects on the spatial and cultural life of the inner-city. Single house lots are rapidly becoming dual-occupancies and back gardens morphing into granny flats and garages. We wanted to find a spatially interesting way of allowing for the need to fill ground space with built form while maintaining garden area, and to avoid the usual forms dictated by local planning codes. </p>

  <p>This project was an extension to the rear of a house we built many years before, and became a way of moving back into some of our old ideas while testing urban density through a hanging garden and a garage as a garden lantern. </p>

  <p>We originally designed the White House Prahran in 2004, and it was built in 2009. When our clients decided to move to Athens a few years ago, the new owners approached us. In the original house we explored a set of spatial ideas that reflected the clients’ paradoxical desires for simultaneously open and closed plans, for a long and narrow site with no light to the centre. We originally used the spatial metaphor of pinball to help resolve the spatial requirements, and the Rorschach to explore levels of abstraction. Almost 20 years later we were asked to revisit the design and extend the house with a rear garage for charging cars and a roof garden. In revisiting an old design, we were confronted with the prospect of either continuing and expanding these original ideas or going in a new direction. </p>

  <p>Previously the back yard was used for entertaining, parking and providing light and perspective to the internal living space. To make up for the lost garden space, we designed a roof terrace and garden above the garage to create more garden space and a terraced perspective from the house. The terrace form relates to the original ‘poche’ courtyard in the house but renews it with an ‘egg’ geometry rather than circular. A rainspout with rain-chain channels the stormwater collected on the roof to a new rain garden at ground level. The walls of the terrace egg have deciduous creeper which over time will grow and transform the egg-shaped space from charcoal to green space with the seasons. The Egg terrace will ideally work as a mini rooftop oasis in the sprawl of the urban field. </p>

  <p>To compensate for the shortened view from the living spaces facing the garden, we placed a polycarbonate wall with a circular silhouette, half on the door and half on the wall, which creates a shadow when the wall lights up at night. This creates a cinematic backdrop to the new garden landscaping and the view from the main living areas. A solid wall to the garage would have created a claustrophobic garden and living spaces inside the house which look onto it and rely on the garden as part of the spatial sequence. The polycarbonate ‘moon’ wall solves this issue and ushers in an experience veering between abstraction and image.</p>

  <p>The plywood circle is inscribed half in the sliding door and half in the polycarbonate wall, lights up like a moon at dusk from the garden but is almost invisible during the day from this aspect. Alternately, during the day it is visible from the interior of the garage and the street. It also changes when the door opens, forming abstract shapes with circular fragments, alternately visible from the interior and exterior. The garage has been designed as an undercover extension to the garden and house’s spatial sequence, which extends the use for entertaining.</p>

  <p>This roof terrace garden pod addresses the street, while adding functionality and new spatial experiences to the existing house, conceptualising the garden as an oasis in the contemporary city.</p>

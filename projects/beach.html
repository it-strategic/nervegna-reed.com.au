      The house was designed for a lot in a small suburban loop in the middle of the 13th Beach golf course. Here we decided to take a typical element of the Australian country house, the veranda, which usually surrounds a house, and make it a conceptual loop cutting through the centre of the house. The veranda as a fan belt-like strip forms an entry at the front and lead the inhabitants into the house, forming a circulation rout which guides one freely to the rooms, the internal courtyard, and ultimately through the living room and to the view of the golf course in the back yard.

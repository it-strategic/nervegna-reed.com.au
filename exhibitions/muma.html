    <p><strong>ADR 19 Exhibit, MUMA (Monash University Museum of Art), 2019</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      The exhibition was intended as a survey of a selection of NR’s architectural video output to be exhibited at the ADR19 conference in 2019. The survey took the form of a spatial video installation that not only showed the videos themselves but also created an experiential space using videos as the building blocks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nervegna Reed use video to compliment an expanded architecture practice. Video is used in a few ways: as documentary, to produce a visual dialogue about architecture, as an exploration into spatiality and image, as installations that explore the relation between image and spatiality and as a type of sketching device to produce new ideas for architectural works.

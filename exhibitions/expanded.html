    <p><strong>Original gallery media release:</strong><br>
      Callum Morton, Anna Nervegna and Danius Kesminus have teamed to remodel gertrude’s white cube into a sporting arena. Playing with architectural scale and appropriated sporting forms, the artists demonstrate a familiarity with the terms and icons of physical and popular culture, putting it all together to expand the field. ‘70s art discourse gets updated 90s style – sporting aesthetics and equipment, youth culture, hype, spectacle, competition … a plethora of connections and associations … this installation is a work out for the senses!

    <p><strong>Original gallery media release:</strong><br>
      E-180 maps and investigates a cultural condition which is now increasingly blurred and out of focus: the relation of the body to objects and images. The video installation layers spatial images upon actual coordinates within the gallery. Mediated through the camera, the TV and the remote control, all surfaces are rendered as one continuous plane which extends from the gallery walls to the fabric and commerce of the city via additional outdoor screenings. An accompanying photographic series details the different recording processes utilised by the viewer / tourist in order to document cultural sightseeing experiences.

      E-180 was accompanied by off-site screenings on the corner of Bourke and Swanston street, Melbourne.

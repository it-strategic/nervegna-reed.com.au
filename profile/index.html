        <strong>Nervegna Reed</strong> Architecture is an award-winning architecture practice established in Melbourne in 2004, working on projects across a broad range of scales and typologies. NR focus on design methodologies which are place based, aiming for unique cultural and programmatic experiences. Each NR design is a unique response to site, program and client. NR’s recent design for the <strong>Central Goldfields Art Gallery</strong> was exhibited in the Australian Pavilion at the 2023 <i>Venice Architecture Biennale</i> and is widely published. The project won the RAIA Victorian Chapter’s <i>John George Knight Award for Heritage Architecture</i>. Other NR projects include large-scale master planning in China, a religious space for the Victorian Quakers Centre (included in Open House culture programs) and social housing and community projects in regional Victoria, Hobart and Melbourne. NR’s micro gallery near Hanging Rock, the <strong>Arrow Studio</strong>, was included in Phaidon’s ‘Nanotecture’ and the ‘Phaidon Atlas of Contemporary World Architecture’ (web edition). NR’s PEP Dandenong (Precinct Energy Project) led the way in Australian architecture and urbanism for green district energy, being the first precinct in Australia to be powered by co-generation. NR extend their architectural dialogue with writings and the making of architectural documentaries and video installations for exhibitions at the RMIT Gallery, RMIT Design Hub, MUMA and the MPavilion. NR’s documentaries ‘The Architecture of Edmond and Corrigan’ and ‘Peter + Dione McIntyre’ both won RAIA Bates Smart Media awards. In 2019 NR led the University of Melbourne’s exhibit in the Chambord Inachevé exhibition curated by Dominique Perrault, in Chateau Chambord, France. In 2018 NR guest edited Architecture Victoria’s special issue ‘The Return of the Object’, and in 2022 guest edited 2A Magazine’s special issues ‘Australia – the World in Reverse’. Recently Toby Reed’s ‘Screenness’ has been published as a chapter in ‘The Physical and the Digital City’ edited by Silvio Carta (Intellect, London / Chicago). Currently NR have projects in Melbourne and regional Victoria.
